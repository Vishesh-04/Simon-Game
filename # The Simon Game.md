 # The Simon Game

This is a simple Simon game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a series of colored buttons that light up in a random sequence. The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order.

## Step 1: HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the game is relatively simple. The main container for the game is a `div` with the class `container`. Inside this container, there are three main sections:

- The header, which contains the game's title and a button to start the game.
- The game board, which contains the colored buttons.
- The footer, which contains the game's score and a button to reset the game.

```html
<div class="container">
  <header>
    <h1>The Simon Game</h1>
    <button id="start-button">Start</button>
  </header>

  <div class="game-board">
    <button class="button red"></button>
    <button class="button yellow"></button>
    <button class="button green"></button>
    <button class="button blue"></button>
  </div>

  <footer>
    <span id="score">Score: 0</span>
    <button id="reset-button">Reset</button>
  </footer>
</div>
```

## Step 2: CSS Styling

The CSS styling for the game is also relatively simple. The main stylesheet is located in the `style.css` file. This file contains the styles for the game's container, header, game board, footer, and buttons.

```css
/* Main container */
.container {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #fff;
}

/* Header */
header {
  text-align: center;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 36px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

#start-button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #000;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

/* Game board */
.game-
